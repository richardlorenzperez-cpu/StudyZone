Product Idea: StudyZone – A Focus Timer for Students Overview: StudyZone is a simple app that helps students manage their study time better. It follows an easy method study for 30 minutes, then rest for 5 minutes. The main goal of this app is to help students stay focused, avoid distractions, and feel less stressed while studying.

Scenario: Many students today find it hard to concentrate, especially when studying online. Things like social media, online/offline games, and notifications can easily break their focus. StudyZone helps by giving students a timer to manage study time, relaxing sounds to stay calm, and motivational quotes to keep them inspired while studying.
 
Initial Scope / Core Features: 
1. Focus Timer – Keeps track of study and break time automatically. 
2. Calming Sounds – Plays relaxing background music while studying. 
3. Motivational Messages – Shows encouraging quotes during study time. 
4. Progress Tracker – Records total study time and number of completed sessions. 
5. User Profiles – Saves each student’s personal progress and details. 

OOP Concepts Applied: 
Encapsulation: This keeps the student’s data like study time or progress safe and private. Only special methods can change or view this data, which protects it from errors or misuse. 

Abstraction: This makes the app easy to use by hiding complicated code. For example, when the user taps “Start,” the app automatically handles the timer, music, and quotes without showing the user all the behind-the-scenes work. 

Inheritance: This lets one class use the features of another. For example, a User class can store basic information like name and email, while a Student class can inherit that and add more features like total study hours or progress. 

Polymorphism: This allows one method to work in different ways. For example, a showMessage() method can show different motivational quotes depending on how long the student has studied. 

Final Project Scope: 

The final version of StudyZone will include: 
•	A working focus timer with customizable study and break times. 
•	A list of relaxing sounds to choose from. 
•	 Changing motivational quotes during study sessions.  
•	A progress tracker that shows total time and achievements. 
•	 Personalized profiles for each user. 

StudyZone will be a simple and helpful that keeps students stay focused, organized, and motivated. It uses object-oriented programming ideas to make the program safe, flexible, and easy to update just like how it helps students make studying easier and more enjoyable.
